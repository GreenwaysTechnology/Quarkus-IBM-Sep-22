What is Quarkus?
  Quarkus is a framework to built on the top of Various java and JEE Standards.

What is Java?
   Java is a technology  which was created to solve the problem of software portability across multi platform(os and hardware) with single source code base / and compiled code(byte) with help of "VM" - (JVM -abstract computer) based computing.
 Which was not possible in c/c++.

Java refers many things 
  - a language  - java programming language
  - a runtime  - jvm
  - tools - compilers,decompilers,packagers...libs(api) (JDK)

Sun Micro systems setup a body/commette in order to standarize the java technology.
  -JCP

What is JCP ?
 Java Community Process is non profitable organization whoes responsability is to standardize the java technology (java echo system).

What is JEP?
 JDK Enchament Proposal, Oracle own body to enchance the features of java
 The JDK Enhancement Proposal (or JEP) is a process drafted by Oracle Corporation for collecting proposals for enhancements to the Java Development Kit and OpenJDK.


JSR-Java Specifcation Request.

Every JSR has unique no - JSR-223

Java Technology Classification

1.JSE
2.JEE
3.JME

1.JSE - Java Standard Edition
  -Java language Spec
  -Java VM Spec


2.JEE - Java Enterise Edition
 The Java Enterprise Edition offers APIs and tools for developing multitier enterprise applications.

 -Application Development Specs
    JPA Spec  - Vendor netural ORM Solutions
    JSON Binding - JSON-B  
    Java Servlet 
    JAX-RS - Building Resfull API
    JAX-WS - Building xml based webservices -SOAP Webservices
    Bean Validation
    JTA  - Java Transaction API
 -Container Specs 
    How to create Enterprise grade applications

3.JME - Java Micro Edition
   For building Device Apps , Mobile Development.


Why JEE Spec failed In Modern Computing?

     JEE Spec was developed to build traditional "Monolothic distributed,transactional, secure Applications"


What if i want to use JEE Spec for building Microservices?

 i cant use JEE Spec directly.

What if i want to build standard based microservices based On JEE?

                       "MicroProfile Specfication"

MicroProfile

Optimizing Enterprise Java - JEE for a Microservices Architecture.


Micro Profile addresses the need for enterprise "java microservices"

It is set of secifications for handling microservices design patterns. 

MicroProfile enables JEE Developers to leverage their existing skill set while shifiting
their focus from traditional monolithic applications to Micro Services


MicroProfile is just collections of MicroServices Service Patterns on JEE standards

Implmentations:

1.Quarkus
etc...

MicroProfile Specs:

1.JAX-RS - To create HTTP based Microservices-
2.CDI - Context Dependency Injection - DI - Beans
3.JSON-B
4.Configuration
5.Falut Management
6.Health
7.Mertics
etc....

What is Quarkus?

 Quarkus is framwork built for building modern cloud and container native microservice,serverless architecture.

Quarkus Features:

1.Implements MicroProfile specification via smallRye project
2.Quarkus implements Reactive Stack via smallRye Muntiny
3.Quarkus implements non blocking architecture via Vert.x Engine
4.Quarkus supports Kubernets,docker ready images
5.Quarkus supports native apps via GraalVM
     -Mandrel: A specialized distribution of GraalVM for Quarkus
6.Quarkus supports hot reloading

Quarkus is collection many projects - modules

Modules:
1.core
2.web
3.data
4.messaging
5.reactive
6.cdi
etc...

how to use Maven as a build tool
how to create and scaffold a new project
how to deal with extensions
how to enable live reload
how to develop your application in your IDE
how to compile your application natively
how to setup Quarkus tools in Visual Studio Code, Eclipse IDE, Eclipse Che and IntelliJ

Project Creations:

1.via Quarkus cli tool
2.via Maven
   2.1.via command line
   2.2.via https://code.quarkus.io/


Quarkus Cli Work Flow:
.....................

Setup cli tool:
https://quarkus.io/get-started

Step : 1 : install jbang build tool via windows powershell with admin access

iex "& { $(iwr https://ps.jbang.dev) } app install --fresh --force quarkus@quarkusio"
[jbang] https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/quarkus/quarkus-cli/2.7.5.Final/quarkus-cli-2.7.5.Final-runner.jar is not from a trusted source thus not running it automatically.

If you trust the url to be safe to run you can do one of the following

(1) Trust once: Add no trust, just download this time (can be run multiple times while cached)
(2) Trust limited url in future: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/quarkus/quarkus-cli/
(0) Cancel

[jbang] Type in your choice and hit enter. Will automatically select option (0) after 30 seconds.

[
Note : after installing , please close the shell/command prompt and relanuch

Step 2: Test quarkus working or not
 quarkus --help

Usage: quarkus [-ehv] [--verbose] [-D=<String=String>]... [COMMAND]
Options:
  -h, --help            Display this help message.
  -v, --version         Print version information and exit.
  -e, --errors          Display error messages.
      --verbose         Verbose mode.
  -D=<String=String>    Java properties

Commands:
  create                  Create a new project.
    app                   Create a Quarkus application project.
    cli                   Create a Quarkus command-line project.
    extension             Create a Quarkus extension project
  build                   Build the current project.
  dev                     Run the current project in dev (live coding) mode.
  extension, ext          Configure extensions of an existing project.
    list, ls              List platforms and extensions.
    categories, cat       List extension categories.
    add                   Add extension(s) to this project.

  registry                Configure Quarkus registry client
    list                  List enabled Quarkus registries

    remove                Remove a Quarkus extension registry
  version                 Display version information.
  completion              bash/zsh completion:  source <(quarkus completion)


Step : 2: create quarkus app via Jbang tool

Open Normal Command Prompt:

quarkus create && cd code-with-quarkus


Step 3: 

How to run Quarkus Project?

   Start running quarkus dev server

3.1.Using Quarkus command

> quarkus dev

3.1.2. via MVN -Running the application in dev mode

./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
or
mvn compile quarkus:dev

			MicroServices - Service Design 
.....................................................................................
Distributed app development Pattern
1.monolithic pattern -  traditional JEE were used for this pattern
2.Microservice pattern - MicroProfile based JEE

Micro service is architectural style for building distributed apps.
Micro service focus is loosly coupled , indepandent dev,deployment,test,maintains apps and cloud based,container based.

What is Service?
  Represents Domain  Entities - Order,Purchase,User,Customer

In Programmetic perspective?
  Service is a program, Service is Object, Which represents state and behaviour...
  Service is an API.

How to design a Service /How design API?

-REST API
-RPC/RPI API
-Message Driven API
-GraphQL API

Quarkus can support all types of microservice  service/api design implementations.
